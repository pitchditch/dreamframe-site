            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              With over 15 years of experience in the exterior cleaning industry, I founded BC Pressure Washing with a simple mission: to deliver exceptional cleaning services with honesty and integrity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              My journey began when I noticed how many homeowners struggled to find reliable, professional cleaning services. I knew there had to be a better wayâ€”one that combined cutting-edge equipment, environmentally friendly techniques, and genuine customer service.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Today, our team serves hundreds of residential and commercial clients throughout the Lower Mainland. We take pride in transforming properties and exceeding expectations with every job.
